### Mar 28 2023 // Dynamically reading checkbox state

1. Added a README.md for adding converters.

- Still need to figure out where to put "user generated folder"

2. Added `getInitialCheckboxState` to pull in proper state from config.
3. Updated UI to pull in proper checkbox state.
4. Likely can skip reading URL Params for now.

**TODO NEXT**

1. Clean up Checkbox state UI
2. Get checkboxes working for Output box as well.
3. Rename `getInitialCheckboxState` to `getInitialConfigState`, make it work for numbered inputs too.
4. Code JsonCsv conversion.
